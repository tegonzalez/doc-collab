# Progress Log

## Session Summary (2025-04-25.2)

**Goal:** Enhance security by removing default values for security variables and ensuring proper handling of environment variables.

**Progress:**

1. **Security Improvements:**
   * Removed insecure default fallbacks for `JWT_SECRET` and `APP_SEED` throughout the codebase
   * Modified middleware to throw errors when security variables are missing rather than using default values
   * Updated the environment loading module to halt application startup if security values aren't properly configured
   * Added proper error messages pointing users to the correct configuration file (`env/security.env`)
   * Fixed `JWT_SECRET_BYTES` handling in middleware to prevent using insecure defaults

2. **Authentication Enhancements:**
   * Completed migration from Edge to Node.js runtime for all authentication-related routes
   * Set up centralized auth module (`src/lib/auth.ts`) with consistent JWT handling
   * Implemented proper environment validation in auth functions
   * Added application seed validation for improved token security

3. **Environment Configuration Improvements:**
   * Ensured all security constants are properly stored in `env/security.env`
   * Implemented strict validation in `src/lib/env.ts` for required security variables
   * Added clear error messages directing to proper configuration files
   * Created consistent security variable access patterns across the codebase

**User Clarifications & Directives:**

* Emphasized need to remove all insecure defaults and enforce proper security configuration
* Clarified that security-related environment variables should be mandatory, with no defaults
* Specified that all security constants should be moved to `env/security.env`
* Instructed to align implementation with the single instance architecture plan in `docs/feature-single-instance.md`
* Required consistent error handling for missing security variables

**AI Learnings & Insights:**

* Security constants should never have default values in production code
* Environment validation should fail fast with clear error messages for security-related variables
* Authentication systems benefit from centralized modules with consistent patterns
* JWT handling requires special attention to ensure no insecure defaults are used
* Security-related environment variables should be mandatory and loaded at application startup
* Proper file organization is essential for security (e.g., keeping security variables in dedicated files)
* Error messages should be informative and direct users to the correct configuration paths

**Implementation Status Against Feature Plan:**

* **Phase 1: Environment Configuration Restructuring** - COMPLETED
  * Created `env` directory structure with proper organization (app.env, security.env)
  * Implemented centralized environment loader in src/lib/env.ts
  * Added validation for required environment variables
  * Relocated JWT_SECRET and APP_SEED to security.env
  * Updated auth system to use environment values

* **Phase 2: Authentication System Fixes** - PARTIALLY COMPLETED
  * Fixed JWT implementation with Node.js crypto libraries (DONE)
  * Standardized session management with proper JWT validation (DONE)
  * Added session token validation in middleware (DONE)
  * JWT token types standardization (PARTIALLY DONE)
  * Welcome experience fixes (NOT STARTED)

* **Phases 3-5** - NOT STARTED
  * LokiJS Cache Implementation (Phase 3)
  * Health Monitoring Enhancement (Phase 4)
  * Route Structure Alignment (Phase 5)

**Current Status:** Authentication system now uses Node.js runtime exclusively with proper security variable handling. The application fails to start if security configuration is missing, rather than using insecure defaults. Security constants are properly stored in the `env/security.env` file. We've completed Phase 1 and part of Phase 2 of the implementation plan. The codebase is now aligned with the strict security requirements outlined in the feature-single-instance.md plan.

## Session Summary (2025-04-25.1)

**Goal:** Begin implementing the Single Instance plan (`docs/feature-single-instance.md`), focusing on removing Edge Runtime and setting up environment configuration.

**Progress:**

1.  **Edge Runtime Removal:**
    *   Modified `next.config.js` to add `experimental.middleware` config enforcing Node.js runtime.
    *   Removed `eslint.ignoreDuringBuilds` and `typescript.ignoreBuildErrors` from `next.config.js` per `codex` rule.
    *   Added `export const runtime = 'nodejs';` to `src/middleware.ts`, `src/app/api/auth/validate/route.ts`, and `src/app/api/auth/signout/route.ts`.
2.  **Environment Configuration Setup (Targeting `./env/` directory):**
    *   Created `src/lib/env.ts` to load variables from files within the `env` directory (`app.env`, `security.env`, `database.env`, `git.env`) using `dotenv`.
    *   Updated `src/lib/auth.ts` to read `APP_SEED` and `JWT_SECRET` from `process.env`, removing database lookup and caching for `APP_SEED`.
    *   Updated `scripts/reset-db.js` to generate new `APP_SEED` and `JWT_SECRET` and write them to `env/security.env` upon execution.
    *   Updated `scripts/generate-admin-link.mjs` to read `APP_SEED` and `JWT_SECRET` from `process.env`.
    *   Attempted to create/manage files (`app.env`, `security.env`) within the `env` directory. Confirmed directory structure with user.

**User Clarifications & Directives:**

*   Corrected initial misinterpretation regarding `.env` filename vs. directory structure. Confirmed target is `./env/` directory.
*   Clarified that the `env` directory was manually created by the user.
*   Provided correct initial content for `env/app.env` after tool failed to overwrite correctly.
*   Explicitly instructed AI to use tools to modify `progress.md`.

**AI Learnings & Insights:**

*   Initial misinterpretation of user correction regarding `.env` filename vs. folder structure led to incorrect file placement.
*   Workspace restrictions (`globalIgnore`) prevented AI tools from directly modifying files within the `.env` (dot-env) directory, requiring a workaround (using `env` directory without leading dot).
*   AI incorrectly assumed it could not create directories, despite evidence in scripts (`fs.mkdirSync`).
*   Erroneously deleted necessary configuration files (`app.env`, `security.env`) from the root based on a faulty assumption, requiring recreation in the correct `./env/` directory.
*   Encountered tool limitations/failures when attempting to overwrite/replace content in `env/app.env`, necessitating manual correction by the user.
*   Need for stricter adherence to confirming file states before performing destructive actions like deletion.
*   Need to explicitly follow through with file modification actions after composing content.

**Current Status:** Code modified to align with the first phase of the plan (Node.js runtime, env config). Waiting for user to confirm `env/app.env` content is correct and provide commands for the HITL checkpoint testing.
